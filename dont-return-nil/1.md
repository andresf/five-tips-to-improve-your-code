#Seems familiar?

undefined method `' for nil:NilClass

I'll show you how far the stack trace goes

#What does nil even mean?

* Boolean?
* Special case?
* Error?
* No Answer?

How do we distinguish them?

!SLIDE

#Boolean?

Don't return nil as a way of returning false.

Don't return an object as a way of returning true.

Be precise in what you return.

    @@@ruby
            def return_bool_always
              !!@some_value
            end

!SLIDE

#Special case?

Consider using the NilObject pattern,  

which provides empty defaults or NOOPs for a class.

    @@@ruby
            class NilLogger
              def log(*); end
            end

!SLIDE

#Error?

Just raise an exception.  

That's what they're for.

    @@@ruby
          model = Model.new
          model.save  # [true, false]
          model.save! # [true, Exception]

      hash = {}
      hash[:key]       # [Object, nil]
      hash.fetch(:key) # [Object, Exception]

!SLIDE

#No Answer?

YES.

Like defining your return type as "void".

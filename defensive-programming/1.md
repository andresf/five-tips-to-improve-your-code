#Defensive programming is bad

(and you should feel bad)

!SLIDE

#Well, actually, defensive programming is okay

It's just terribly misunderstood.

My code is so awesome.

    @@@ruby
    def awesomerizer(stuff)
      puts "#{stuff.name} is so awesome."
    end

Oh wait, what if stuff is nil?

!SLIDE

    @@@ruby
    def kinda_awesomerizer(stuff)
      if !stuff.nil?
        puts "#{stuff.name} is so awesome."
      end
    end

Oh wait, what if stuff isn't the class we expect?

!SLIDE

    @@@ruby
    def this_is_kinda_sucky(stuff)
      if !stuff.nil? &&
        stuff.is_a?(Stuffer)
        puts "#{stuff.name} is so awesome."
      end
    end

Oh wait, what if it's a subclass that doesn't have a name?

!SLIDE

    @@@ruby
    def now_you_re_just_trolling_me(stuff)
      if !stuff.nil? &&
        stuff.is_a?(Stuffer) &&
        stuff.respond_to?(:name)
        puts "#{stuff.name} is so awesome."
      end
    end

Perfect.

#Why is this a problem?

* My stuff isn't being awesomerized
* Special cases suck
* Nil isn't awesome
* If I break the expectations, I should get called out on it ASAP
* The failure should be close to the cause
* Chasing nils down the stack isn't fun

#Ruby is a dynamic language

Embrace the power of duck-typing.  

Type checks and respond_to? checks 
are a throwback to static languages.  

Quack.

#How are nils getting to your code, anyway?

#(ZOMG again)
